## 📌 About This Project

This project is part of the **Project Based Learning (PBL)** program  
at **Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School**, Academic Year 2025.

**Project Title:**  
RIASEC-Based Personality Assessment Website Development  
(Based on John L. Holland’s RIASEC Theory)

The website aims to help users:
- Understand their interests and personality tendencies
- Use the assessment results as guidance for educational planning, career exploration, and self-development


## 🧠 Theoretical Background: RIASEC (Holland Codes)

RIASEC is a career interest theory developed by **John L. Holland**, classifying individuals into six personality types:

- **R – Realistic**: Practical, hands-on, tool-oriented
- **I – Investigative**: Analytical, scientific, problem-solving oriented
- **A – Artistic**: Creative, expressive, imaginative
- **S – Social**: Cooperative, helpful, people-oriented
- **E – Enterprising**: Leadership, persuasion, decision-making oriented
- **C – Conventional**: Organized, systematic, data-oriented

The system analyzes user decisions across multiple scenarios  
and summarizes the results as a RIASEC personality profile.


## 🎮 Website Design Concept

- Uses **story-based assessment** instead of conventional questionnaires
- Users make choices within simulated situations
- Each decision contributes weighted scores mapped to RIASEC dimensions
- Results are presented in a clear, practical, and easy-to-understand format
- Fully responsive for both **desktop and mobile devices**
